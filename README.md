This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a react app that utilized the Edamam Recipe Search API (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) in order to display recipes from their database. 

* [x] Implemented search bar in order to search for any recipe
* [x] Display all recipes from the the search on the screen using the API
* [x] implemented get recipe button which displays the full recipe from the API url
